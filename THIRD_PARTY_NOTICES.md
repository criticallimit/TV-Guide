# Third-party notices and rights

TV Guide is an independent open-source project and is not affiliated with,
endorsed by, or sponsored by any television broadcaster, network, programme
provider, EPG provider, or Home Assistant.

## Licence scope

The MIT License in this repository applies to project-authored source code and
project-authored documentation unless a file states otherwise.

It does **not** grant any rights in third-party material, including:

- television channel names, trademarks and logos;
- programme titles, descriptions, images or other editorial content;
- EPG/XMLTV databases or data obtained from external providers;
- material fetched from broadcaster websites, APIs or teletext services.

Rights in such material remain with their respective owners and may be subject
to separate licences, terms of use, database rights, copyright, trademark law,
or other restrictions.

## Programme data

TV Guide retrieves programme information from external public sources at
runtime. Source availability does not by itself mean that the source or its
content is licensed for unrestricted reuse or redistribution.

Configured source families currently include, depending on country and
availability:

- Open-EPG XMLTV feeds;
- EPGshare XMLTV feeds;
- public programme pages, APIs and teletext services operated by broadcasters;
- secondary public programme pages used to fill gaps.

Source URLs and country mappings are documented in
`tv-guide/data/COUNTRY_SOURCES.md` and the source configuration files.

No external programme data is relicensed under the MIT License by this project.
Users and distributors remain responsible for complying with the applicable
terms of the external source and the rights in the underlying programme
content.

## Channel logos and trademarks

Bundled channel logos and wordmarks are third-party trademarks and/or
copyrighted brand assets. They are not covered by the MIT License.

Some assets were derived from or based on material obtained from broadcaster
websites, programme feeds, or the public `tv-logo/tv-logos` collection.
Provenance information is recorded in `tv-guide/data/logo_manifest.json` and
`tv-guide/data/LOGOS.md`.

The upstream `tv-logo/tv-logos` project describes its collection as free for
personal use, asks for attribution when redistributing, and refers to a mixture
of Creative Commons ShareAlike licences. It does not provide one repository-wide
LICENSE file or a per-logo licence map. Accordingly, this project does not claim
that every bundled third-party logo has a uniform open-source licence.

The repository also contains a generated Europe-wide offline logo pack built
from a pinned snapshot of `tv-logo/tv-logos`. That pack is distributed only as
third-party branding material and is not covered by this project's MIT licence.
The upstream project's attribution and redistribution statements therefore
continue to apply in addition to the rights of each broadcaster or trademark
holder.

If you are a rights holder and believe that a logo or other third-party asset
should be removed, corrected or attributed differently, please open an issue in
this repository.

## Project branding

The TV Guide project name, project-specific icon, project-specific logo and
other original project branding are not intended to grant trademark rights
under the MIT License. The MIT licence covers the copyright in project-authored
software; it does not grant rights to impersonate the project or suggest
endorsement.

## No warranty for external data

Programme information may be incomplete, delayed, changed or unavailable.
TV Guide does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness or continued
availability of third-party programme data.


## Additional reviewed sender artwork

The channel-specific additions recorded in `tv-guide/data/logo_updates.json`
include images supplied by the XMLTV feeds and public broadcaster/distributor
image servers. Some missing sources were discovered through the public
[iptv-org/api catalogue](https://github.com/iptv-org/api). Source URLs and hashes
are recorded per channel; embedded image hashes and preparation details are in
`tv-guide/data/logo_library.json` and the prepared-library parts indexed by
`tv-guide/data/logo_updates.json`. The catalogue's software/data licence does not
grant trademark or copyright rights to broadcaster artwork. These additional
third-party marks are not covered by this project's MIT licence.

E4, Film4, More4 and 5USA now use bundled broadcaster artwork. The older neutral
UK wordmarks remain compatibility assets, but are no longer used by the main
channel catalogue. Channel names and marks belong to their respective owners.
